### Static Analysis Standards

The code coverage target for this project is 70% by block as measured by emma.  A coverage report is built automatically via ant.

As of 23/8/2013, we have only reached 59% by block.  Until 70% is reached, no changes must be committed that would reduce this figure.  Once 70% is reached, no changes must be committed that would reduce the figure to below 70%.  Contirbutions will be rejected on this basis.

This code is analaysed using findbugs.  The project's tolerances allow for one high priority warning, two normal priority warnings, and unlimited low priority warnings, per 5,000 lines of Java code, excluding comments and whitespace.  As of 23/8/13, the project comprises of 3190 lines of Java Code (from a total of 7100 lines of code).  No commites must be made outside of these tolerances, and contributions which breach these tolerances will be rejected.
