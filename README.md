======================================================

### Summary

This module adds Enhanced Security Labelling to an Alfresco Repository.


### Static Analysis Standards

The code coverage target for this project is 70% by block as measured by emma.  A coverage report is built automatically via ant.

As of 23/8/2013, we have only reached 60% by block.  Until 70% is reached, no changes must be committed that would reduce this figure.  Once 70% is reached, no changes must be committed that would reduce the figure to below 70%.  Contirbutions will be rejected on this basis.
