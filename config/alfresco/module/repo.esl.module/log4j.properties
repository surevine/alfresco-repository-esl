   #   NOTE
   #   ----
   #      Log4j uses the following logging levels:
   #      debug,info,warn,error,fatal
   #
   #      To set the logging level of {fullClassName} to {loglevel},
   #      add a line to this file of the following form:
   #   
   #               log4j.logger.{fullClassName}={loglevel}
   #
   #      For example, to make 'com.example.MyExample' produce 'debug'
   #      logs, add a line like this:
   #   
   #               log4j.logger.com.example.MyExample=debug
   #
   #
   #   WARNING

   #       those in the webapp's main log4j.properties.
